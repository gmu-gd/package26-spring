I"Ø<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Create a starter pack that has, what you consider, the three most important items for some group of people. If you donâ€™t have or want to think about that group of people, use graphic designers. You can choose any items, but they must be able to fit into a package that you can design and build. You will also create a name and a visual identity for your package that ties all the items together. If you chose an already branded item you can make it generic OR have the branded item in your package but ignore the branding.</p>
