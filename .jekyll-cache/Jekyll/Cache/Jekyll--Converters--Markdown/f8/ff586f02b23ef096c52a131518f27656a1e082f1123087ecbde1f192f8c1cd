<p>Create a brand and Halloween themed packaging for you and your partner’s succulent holder. You will come up with a name, visual design, and package. The container for your succulent holders should be assembled cleanly and nicely with the visual design on it (not a prototype but a more finished package). The brand is a brick and mortar store that sells indoor plants and related items. They also offer themed holiday gift sets, which is what you are designing.</p>
