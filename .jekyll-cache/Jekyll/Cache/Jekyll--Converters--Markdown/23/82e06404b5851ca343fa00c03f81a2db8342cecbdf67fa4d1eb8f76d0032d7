I"Ð	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Design and construct a package that contains three variations of the same (or similar) item. You will create a visual identity, design for the container of the items, and the labels/packaging for the items themselves. The design of the items must work as a system, not as three individual designs.</p>
